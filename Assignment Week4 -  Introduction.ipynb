    "  <b>  New York City's demographics show that it is a large and ethnically diverse metropolis. It is the largest city in the United States with a long history of international immigration. New York City was home to nearly 8.5 million people in 2018, accounting for over 40% of the population of New York State and a slightly lower percentage of the New York metropolitan area, home to approximately 23.6 million. Over the last decade the city has been growing faster than the region. The New York region continues to be by far the leading metropolitan gateway for legal immigrants admitted into the United States.<br/>\n",
    " </b><b>   \n",
    "    In this project we will go through the entire neighborhood of New York by analyzing the chain of restaurants serving Indian food nearby.By doing this we will be able to decide whether it is wise to open an Indian restaurant. For analysis we will find the preferred cuisine of the population, most profitable area as to figure out the area where most of the population visits. If the area is profitable, where exactly the restaurant should be so that the business yields more profit to the owner.\n",
